      <h2 id="articles">Why does my file have funny characters in it?</h2>

<p>One of the most common problems that people come across when moving
files between different computer systems is that their line endings seem
to be destroyed. In this article, Dave Cross looks at this problem and
suggests some simple solutions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>If it hasn’t happened to you at some point then I can almost
guarantee that it will in the future. You transfer a text file from a
DOS/Windows system to a Unix system using FTP and every line has gained
extra <code>^M</code> characters; or you transfer a text file the other
way only to find that all the lines have run together and where the line
endings were there is a strange black rectangle.</p>
<p>You have become a victim of the non-standardisation of line endings
across different operating systems.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-line-endings">What are line endings?</h3>
<p>When you edit a text file in your favourite editor, whether it is an
HTML page, the source code of a computer program, a poem or a shopping
list, you press the Return (or Enter) key at the end of each line. This
really changes nothing in the meaning of the file (your browser would
still be able to display HTML that all appeared on one line) it merely
makes it easier for you (or other humans) to read the file.</p>
<p>When you press the enter key, the computer needs to mark the point in
the file where the line break occurs. It does this by inserting a
special character (strictly speaking, at least one special character)
into the file at this point. When displaying or printing the file for
you in the future, the editor knows that the special character means
“don’t display this character, but display the character after this on a
new line”.</p>
<p>The problem occurs when you try to define which special characters to
use. There are two characters in the standard ASCII character set that
might be used for this purpose, the line feed (LF) character with ASCII
code 10 and the carriage return (CR) character with ASCII code 13. There
is really very little real choice between these two characters, but a
choice must be made when designing an operating system.</p>
<p>Of course, just because one set of operating system designers choose
one particular character, it doesn’t mean that all subsequent operating
system designers will agree with their decision. Herein lies our
problem. The three most used operating systems today are Unix (in all of
its varients – including Linux), Windows and MacOS and just to keep
things as complex as possible, they all use different line end
characters. Here is a table showing which characters the various systems
use.</p>
<p>Line end characters on the three most popular operating systems</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>OS</th>
<th>Line End</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Unix</td>
<td>LF</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Windows/DOS</td>
<td>CR/LF</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>MacOS</td>
<td>CR</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, this selection just about covers all possibilities.
Unix and MacOS both choose a different one of the characters and Windows
is greedy and insists on them both (and notice that they must be in the
order given, CR before LF). Armed with this knowledge we can begin to
explain what goes wrong when you move a text file from its native
operating system.</p>
<h3 id="moving-text-files">Moving Text Files</h3>
<p>It is important to note that a text file when stored on disk does not
contain the text formatted into lines. The lines are stored in one long
stream of binary data. It is only when the text is displayed (in an
editor or by printing the file) that the special line end characters are
interpreted in a manner that will reformat the text into lines.</p>
<p>Normally when you move a text file onto another operating system the
binary data is left untouched (that ‘normally’ hints at a solution which
we will come to in more detail later). Let’s examine what happens in
some common cases and see if we can explain the problems described
above.</p>
<h3 id="windows-to-unix">Windows to Unix</h3>
<p>Imagine a Unix editor (like vi or emacs) opening a text file that was
created under Windows. The text characters in the first line are all
interpreted correctly. At the end of the line, we find a CR. This means
nothing special to Unix so the editor attempts to display the character.
CR is a non-printable character, which means that it has no obvious
visual representation. Under Unix many of these non-printable characters
are mapped to control characters when displayed. In the case of CR, its
displayable equivalent is Control-M. This is displayed in most editors
as <code>^M</code>.</p>
<p>The next character is a LF. Unix has no problems with this character
as it is the standard line end character. The editor therefore moves to
the start of the next line on the display and starts to process the next
line.</p>
<p>In this way you can see that the file will be displayed with an extra
<code>^M</code> at the end of each line, but with the line endings
intact.</p>
<p>Imagine now a Windows editor (like Notepad) trying to display a text
file that was created under Unix. The text characters in the first line
are all interpreted correctly. At the end of the first line the editor
finds a LF character. Under Windows this is not a valid line end
character as it was not preceded by a CR. The editor therefore just
prints the character. Unfortunately, LF is a non-printable character and
in most Windows editors, a non-printable character is displayed as a
black rectangle.</p>
<p>The editor now moves on to the second line in the file and finds more
normal text characters. As there has been no CR/LF combination to
indicate the end of the line, the editor just prints the next line
straight after the black rectangle.</p>
<p>As the editor moves through the file it displays each line straight
after the previous one, separated only by the black rectangle that
represent the unprintable LF character.</p>
<h3 id="macintosh-transfers">Macintosh Transfers</h3>
<p>Hopefully you can now see how these problems are caused. I’ll leave
it to you to think about what will happen when Unix or Windows files are
transfered to a Macintosh.</p>
<h3 id="problems-caused">Problems Caused</h3>
<p>So how much of a problem does this cause?</p>
<p>It depends really on what you were planning to do with the file. If
it was intended for humans to read, then obviously something needs to be
done to fix the formatting. On the other hand, if it was intended for
machine consumption (like a HTML page or program source code) then you
might find that the broken line endings don’t matter. If your program
gives unexpected results then it might be worth investigating wherther
the input files have come from another system and might be suffering
from this problem.</p>
<h3 id="solutions">Solutions</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways to get round or fix this problem. In
increasing order of complexity, they are:</p>
<h4 id="fixing-the-file-in-an-editor">Fixing the file in an editor</h4>
<p>If you have a broken file and you want to fix it quickly, it may be
possible to fix it using your editor. Certainly on Unix, most editors
are powerful enough to fix this problem. For example if you have the
file open in vi, you can fix the problem by entering the following
command.</p>
<pre><code>:1,$/^M//g</code></pre>
<p>(You can enter the <code>^M</code> character by holding down the
control key whilst pressing M at the same time.)</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this option is open to you on Windows or MacOS,
certainly Notepad doesn’t have the capability to fix this problem. If
anyone can give any more information on this, then please let me
know.</p>
<h4 id="fixing-the-file-during-transfer">Fixing the file during
transfer</h4>
<p>Remember earlier when I said that when moving files to another
operating system, the binary data in the file was normally unaltered.
Well, it is possible to fix the data during transfer, depending on the
transfer method you use.</p>
<p>The most common way to move files between different systems is by
using File Transfer Protocol (or FTP). FTP is a widely implemented
protocol for moving files from one computer to another. You access FTP
by using an FTP client program. This might be a command line program
that is just called FTP or a GUI-based drag and drop program like WS-FTP
or Cute FTP. If you transfer the file using an FTP client you can put
the client into ASCII transfer mode. This means that all line endings
will be converted to the correct type for the target system during the
transfer. A tutorial into using FTP clients is beyond the scope of this
article but it is worth noting that many newer FTP clients have the
ability to automatically change transfer mode depending on the extension
of the file being transfered. You may need to configure the client to
understand that more esoteric extensions are, in fact, text files.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don’t need to explicitly transfer files from one system
to another. Simply moving the file to another directory on the the same
system is enough. This is because the directory is cross-mounted from
another system. In this way it is possible to see Unix directories from
a Windows machine. The most common method for achieving this is using
something like the Network File System (NFS). Obviously, with NFS you
can’t change the transfer mode as there isn’t a transfer as such. It is,
however, often possible to configure NFS to automatically switch into
ASCII mode depending on the extension of the file.</p>
<h4 id="fixing-the-file-with-software">Fixing the file with
software</h4>
<p>Some Unix varients come complete with filter programs called
<code>dos2unix</code> and <code>unix2dos</code> which will handle the
conversions for you. They are implemented as filters to make them as
flexible as possible. From the command line, they are invoked as
follows.</p>
<pre><code>dos2unix &lt; DOS_file.txt &gt; Unix_file.txt</code></pre>
<p>If your operating system doesn’t have these filters then it is easy
enough to create them in your favourite language. Here is an example of
<code>dos2unix</code> written in Perl.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
use strict;

while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
  s/\r\n/\n/;
  print;
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>This is certainly becoming one of the the most common problems that I
see discussed on Usenet. It has become much more prevalent now that
people create many files on Windows machines and then transfer them up
to their Internet Service Provider’s system which is probably running
Linux or some other Unix varient.</p>
<p>I hope that by explaining the problem and suggesting some solutions I
can help to stop too much time from being wasted discussing this simple
problem.</p>
