      <h2 id="articles">It's not still 1998</h2>

<p>Why do so many web sites ignore the advances in web technology that
have been made since 1998?</p>
<p>This article was originally written as a weblog for <a
href="http://www.ecademy.com/">Ecademy</a> in September 2002.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cast your mind back to 1998. The web was a mess. This was largely due
to the fact that there were two major browsers and they both supported
large amounts of non-standard HTML that was incompatible with the
competing browser. It seemed that most sites you visited were only
visible in Internet Explorer or (less commonly) Netscape. In the cases
where sites worked equally well in both of the major browsers, this was
more than likely because the developers had, in fact, created two sites
and determined which one to send you by working out which browser you
were using. Developing and maintaining a site in such circumstances was
a nightmare.</p>
<p>Into this world came the Web Standards Project. They made it their
mission to talk to the large browser companies and the W3C to come to
some agreement that would solve this problem.</p>
<p>And they pretty much succeeded in their mission. If you look around
today the two major browsers support much the same dialects of HTML
(HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0), with very similar versions of JavaScript,
similar DOM support and similar levels of support for CSS2. We have all
the tools in place to create great web sites that work well in both
major browsers (and many more besides – but we’ll get to that
later).</p>
<p>But we don’t see that. We still see sites that claim they are
IE-only. We still see sites that are made of some nightmare version of
HTML that might almost be HTML 3.2 (but isn’t anywhere near being
valid). We still see ($deity help us) browser sniffing.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this">Why is this?</h3>
<p>In my opinion, the reason is that whilst we’ve made massive
improvements in the available tools, we’re still stuck with the same
designers andi developers. No-one has told the majority of the web
designers out there that it’s no longer 1998. You don’t need to use the
&lt;font&gt; tag any more. The vast majority of your visitors will be
using a browser that supports CSS – which actually gives you more
control over how the page looks than the technology that they’re
currently using.</p>
<p>Or maybe it isn’t the designers. Maybe today’s CTOs are people who
were designers in 1998 and they haven’t bothered to keep up to date with
what’s going on in web technology.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, I think I’m actually seeing an increase in
IE-only web sites. Three examples that I’ve seen recently – the Alexa
toolbar that Thomas (note: Thomas Power – who runs Ecademy) is so keen
on only works on IE, the Internet bank Egg have recently introduced new
features that only work on IE and this week four UK companies introduced
a combined customer loyalty card called Nectar. They encourage people to
register for this site on the web and guess what – the site only works
in IE.</p>
<p>Another argument that you’ll hear is that they’ll target IE because
the vast majority of users are using IE. This is, of course, true – but
let me present a few counter arguments.</p>
<p>It may be true that only 5% of your visitors are using non-IE
browsers, but that’s 5% of potential customers who won’t see your site.
In my experience creating a site that targets web standards and will
therefore run on 100% of browsers is actually easier that creating one
that only targets IE. So you’re spending extra effort to cut your
potential market. Does that sound like good business sense?</p>
<p>Secondly, you might be right that 95% of users are using IE, but
which version of IE are they using? If you’re using IE-specific features
then the version will matter. Things that work in IE 6.0 won’t look the
same (or won’t work at all) in IE 4.0. And there are people still using
IE 4.0.</p>
<p>Finally, the trend in the browser market has been for more and more
people to use IE. But that can’t go on. It looks like AOL will be
introducing a Mozilla-based browser as standard in the near future. Do
you really want to miss out on all the AOL users? Linux usage on the
desktop is growing so you’ll see more and more people using things like
Galeon and Konquerer. Even amongst Windows users, Mozilla and Opera are
slowly growing in popularity. And what about non-PC devices? Will you
support users browsing on their TV? Or their Palm Pilot? Or their mobile
phone?</p>
<p>For so many reasons, developing sites that only target IE is a really
bad idea. The tools are there to create better sites that can be seen by
more people. There’s no reason to still act like you’re stuck in
1998.</p>
<p>(And one last parenthetical point. If you’re going to insist on an
IE-only site, then please don’t show me a page suggesting that I
“upgrade” to IE in order to use it. I’m already using the most recent
version of Mozilla, which is far more capable than IE. Switching to IE
would be a downgrade and is therefore a step that I don’t intend to
take.)</p>
