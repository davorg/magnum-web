      <h2 id="articles">Talks</h2>

<p>On this page you will (eventually) find links to all of the talks
that Magnum Solutions staff have given at various conferences and
meetings. Currently these are scattered rather haphazardly across a
couple of sites, so it might take a while to get them organised. Please
bear with us whilst we work it out.</p>
<p>Some of these talks will look slightly strange until we spend some
time clearing up the formatting.</p>
