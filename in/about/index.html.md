# About

Magnum Solutions was started in 1995 when Dave Cross left Buena Vista
Home Entertainment (part of the Walt Disney Company) to become an independent
contractor working in the City of London.

Originally Dave specialised in Unix and database systems, but within a year
or so he had encountered Perl and that soon became his primary focus.

Since that time, Dave has worked for a wide range of companies in London from
some of the largest investment banks to some tiny dotcom start-up companies.
