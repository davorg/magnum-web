# Open Source Software

Magnum Solutions specialises in Open Source Software. In this section we take
a look at what Open Source Software is and discuss what advantages it has for
your business.

## What is Open Source Software?

Most software that you buy is distributed in the form of binary files. This
means that the source code has already been converted into a set of
instructions that your computer will understand. If you try to look at the
contents of these files you’ll see that it’s impossible for a human to
understand.

With Open Source Software, the software is distributed in a different format.
You get the source code to the program. You then translate this source code
into the computer instructions yourself.

The concept of Open Source Software is also very tightly tied in with the Free
Software Movement. This means that Open Source Software is free (as in “free
speech”) so that you are allowed to change it in any way to want. It is also
often free in the other sense (as in “free beer”) so that typically it’s much
cheaper than “closed source” software.

## The Advantages Of Open Source Software

We believe that using Open Source Software gives a number of advantages over
other types of software. The advantages include:

* Cost  
Open Source Software is often distributed free. This means that the costs of
software licenses can be better spent on development or support costs.

* Support  
Most pieces of Open Source Software are supported by large numbers of
volunteers. Often a question posted to a mailing list will get a response
within minutes. If there is a bug in the software then a fix will often be
supplied within a few hours.

* Transparency  
Because you have access to the source code you can always find out exactly
how a piece of code works. This allows you to develop your own software so
it works seamlessly with whatever Open Source Software you are using. Or you
can change the Open Source Software so that it integrates perfectly with your
existing systems. You will no longer be tied into one company’s idea about
how your system should work.

* Security  
Open Source Software is usually developed by large teams of programmers
collaborating over the Internet. This means that each line of code is seen by
many people. This drastically reduces the chances of insecurities and bugs
going unnoticed.

## Examples of Open Source Software

The Internet largely runs on Open Source Software. Here are some examples of
Open Source Software projects that you may have heard of:

* Linux  
Linux is a complete Unix-like operating system. Strictly Linux is just the
core (or “kernel”) of the project and the surrounding utilities and
applications come from other sources – many of them were written as part of
the GNU project.

* Apache  
By far the most popular Web Server software on the Internet.

* BIND  
A crucial part of the Internet is the translation of host names (like
mag-sol.com) to unique numberic addresses (like 212.227.164.62). BIND is the
most popular software for doing this.

* sendmail  
Another largely hidden workhorse. Many email servers on the Internet use
sendmail to route email.

* Perl  
f you visit a web site where you can search for data, then there’s a good
chance that the search facility is written in Perl. For many years Perl
has been recognised as the best language for writing dynamic web sites. And
it’s capable of doing so much more.

* OpenOffice.org  
If you want a suite of office applications to do all the things that Microsoft
Office can do, then take a look at OpenOffice.org.
