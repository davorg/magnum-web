Dave Cross has been working in the IT industry since 1988. Much of that time
has been spent manipulating data and databases in some way.

In 1995 Dave discovered Perl, the data manipulation language *par excellence*
and he hasn’t needed to program in much else since.

Also in 1995, Dave set up Magnum Solutions as a company that would promote the
use of Open Source software (or, as it was then called, “free software”) in
its clients.

In 2000, Dave branched out and started writing and speaking about Perl. His
first book *Data Munging with Perl* was published in January 2001. *Perl
Template Toolkit* followed in December 2003. Dave is now a regular speaker
at Perl and Open Source conferences.
