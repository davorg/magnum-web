title: Perl Mongers Census 2008
---

This page used to hold the data from a census of the
[Perl Mongers groups](https://pm.org/) that I took back in 2008. Over fifteen
years on, I suspect that the data is of no interest and the technology I
used to present the data has all bit-rotted and rather than invest the time
I’d need to get it up and running again, I’ve decided to remove it.

If you’re really interested in the data, then [get in touch](/contact/) and
I’ll find a way to get it to you.
