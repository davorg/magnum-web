# Magnum Solutions Limited

This is the site that Dave Cross used to promote his open source software
consultancy from the date the domain was registered in 1997 until the end
of 2023.

Most of the useful stuff that used to be here is now on
[davecross.co.uk](https://davecross.co.uk/) or
[perlhacks.com](https://perlhacks.com/). Or, perhaps, you'll find something
useful or interesting on the [link farm](https://links.davecross.co.uk/).

All of the old links should still work though (either by redirecting to a new
version or by going to a hidden page on this site). If you follow a broken
link to a page on [mag-sol.com](https://mag-sol.com/) then let us know by
emailing [hello@mag-sol.com](mailto:hello@mag-sol.com) and we'll do what
we can to get things fixed.
