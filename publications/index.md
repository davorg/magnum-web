## Books

* ***Data Munging with Perl***  
Many books on Perl concentrate on its use as in CGI programming. But
that’s not what Perl was designed for – or even what it does best.
*Data Munging with Perl* looks at efficient ways to use Perl to manipulate
data in its many forms.

* ***Perl Template Toolkit***  
The only book to cover the Template Toolkit.
