On this page you will (eventually) find links to all of the talks
that Magnum Solutions staff have  given at various conferences and
meetings. Currently these are scattered rather haphazardly across
a couple of sites, so it might take a while to get them organised.
Please bear with us whilst we work it out.

Some of these talks will look slightly strange until we spend some
time clearing up the formatting.
